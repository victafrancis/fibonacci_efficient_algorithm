# fibonacci_efficient_algorithm
Traditional Fibonacci functions require the use of recursive functions. This is very inefficient when calculating Fibonacci numbers from 40 and above, and takes a lot of time to calculate. In this algorithm, I used an array to store previously calculated Fibonacci numbers and counted upwards instead of downwards. This made the calculation more efficient  as recalculation is not required and already stored in an array.
